            <h2>Jeremy & Avery</h2>
            <p>
              Hi there! We are Jeremy and Avery Johnson and we are excited to
              share our adoption journey with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have now been married for ten years and the time truly has
              flown by! After struggling with infertility for many years, we
              decided God was calling us to begin our family through adoption.
              We have several family members who were adopted, including
              Jeremy's mom, and saw how beautiful that process can be.
            </p>
            <p>
              We adopted our son Ezra over five years ago and are now feeling
              the push again from God to continue growing our family through
              adoption!
            </p>
            <p>
              There's never a dull moment in our household! You will find us
              doing just about anything, from going to the park to travelling to
              Disney World. Just as much as we love being busy, we still know
              the perfect balance of just staying at home and playing with toys
              or watching movies together.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are so excited to grow our family again and even Ezra says he
              is ready for a baby too!
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for taking the time to visit our page and read more
              about us!
